"November 23, 2023 - Kyber Network tweeted that KyberSwap Elastic has experienced a security incident. According to the analysis of the SlowMist security team, the root cause of this attack is that in calculating the number of tokens needed for the exchange from the current price to the boundary scale price, the liquidity will be added to the portion of the fee compounding because of KyberSwap Elastic's reinvestment curve, thus causing its calculation result to be larger than expected, which can cover the user's need for exchange, but the actual price has already crossed the boundary scale, which makes the protocol think that the liquidity within the current scale has already met the need for exchange, and therefore does not carry out liquidity update. The protocol assumes that the liquidity within the current scale is sufficient to cover the redemption needs, and therefore does not update the liquidity. The result is that the liquidity is increased twice when the reverse exchange crosses the boundary scale, allowing the attacker to obtain more tokens than expected. On Nov. 27, the Kyber Network tweeted that the KyberSwap team had contacted the owner of the frontrun bots that had withdrawn approximately $5.7 million from the KyberSwap pool on Polygon and Avalanche. After negotiations, the owners of the frontrun bots have agreed to return 90% of their users' funds to a designated address. In return, they will receive a 10% bounty. On December 13th, the KyberSwap team recovered approximately $508,000 worth of  funds from the owners of frontrun bots.

"September 05, 2023 - According to a number of community users, there seems to be a problem in the Layer2 interoperability protocol Connext airdrop claim process. The NEXT tokens of some accounts were claimed to unexpected addresses. The data on the chain shows that the address starting with 0x44Af received a large number of Connext token NEXT airdrops through 230 accounts in the past 1 hour, and sold them all for ETH, USDT and USDC, earning nearly 39,000 US dollars. According to SlowMist analysis, users can claim NEXT tokens through the claimBySignature function of the NEXT Distributor contract. There are recipient and beneficiary roles, the recipient role is used to receive the NEXT tokens of the claim, and the beneficiary role is the address that is eligible to receive NEXT tokens, which has been determined when the Connext protocol announces the air investment qualifications. When the user makes a NEXT token claim, the contract will perform two checks: one is to check the signature of the beneficiary role, and the other is to check whether the beneficiary role is eligible to receive the airdrop. During the first check, it will check whether the recipient passed in by the user is signed by the beneficiary role, so the random incoming recipient address cannot pass the check if it is not signed by the beneficiary. If you specify a beneficiary address to construct a signature, even if it can pass the signature check, it cannot pass the second check on the eligibility for airdrops. Airdrop claim eligibility checks are checked through Merkle proofs, which should be officially generated by the Connext protocol. Therefore, users who are not eligible to receive airdrops cannot bypass the check to receive other people's airdrops. On September 7, Connext released a post-mortem analysis, stating that the attacker performed DOS operations on Tokensoft’s API, causing the claim database and UI to crash. During this process, 274,956 NEXT from 253 wallets (not related to Connext) were claimed (0.26% of the total airdrop) and sold for approximately 40,000 USDT before ordinary users were able to claim it.

"May 29, 2023 - Blockchain security researcher iczc tweeted that a vulnerability was found in Polygon zkEVM and received a bug bounty from Immunefi L2. The vulnerability prevents asset migration from L1 to L2 by preventing assets bridged from L1 to Polygon zkEVM (L2) from being properly claimed in L2. iczc found in the code logic of processing claim tx pre-execution results that malicious attackers can bypass the ""isReverted"" pre-execution check on claim transactions by setting the gas fee to non-zero, allowing them to send a large number of Low-cost claims DoS attacks on sequencers and validators, increasing computational overhead. Also, transactions are not immediately removed from the pool after execution. The status is updated from Pending to Selected and continues to exist in the PostgreSQL database. Currently, there is only one trusted sequencer capable of fetching transactions from the transaction pool and executing them. Therefore, another vulnerability is to maliciously mark any deposit amount by sending a failed transaction. This will cause claim transactions that correctly use credits to be rejected because the credits are already used. This makes the L2 network unusable for new users. The Polygon zkEVM team fixed this vulnerability by removing the specific gas logic for claiming transactions, with no funds at risk.",Polygon zkEVM,-,Logic Vulnerability,https://twitter.com/0xiczc/status/1662090451493740545,388

Two key factors contributed to the success of the attack: 1. Funds were donated to the reserved address without being subjected to a liquidity check. This created a mechanism that could directly trigger soft liquidation. 2. When the soft liquidation logic was triggered by high leverage, the yield value increased, enabling the liquidator to obtain most of the collateral funds from the liquidated user's account by transferring only a portion of the liabilities to themselves. Given that the value of the collateral funds exceeded the value of the liabilities (which were only partially transferred due to the soft liquidation), the liquidator was able to successfully pass their health factor check (checkLiquidity) and withdraw the obtained funds.

Regarding the destroyed ENS domain name, Johnson said it was the first registered ENS domain name, called rilxxlir.eth, which was held by an ENS account when Johnson registered it with personal funds. In order to transfer the ENS domain name to his own account, he went to OpenSea to perform the transfer, only to find that it had been sent to a destruction address by mistake. Since Johnson is still the controller of the ENS domain name, he can still make changes, just cannot move the domain name. Johnson then received further reports from others who were similarly affected and compiled a list of 32 affected transactions involving 42 NFTs. Most NFTs use the ERC-721 standard, but a few use ERC-1155. He looked at the floor price of each NFT, which totaled about $100,000. Johnson claims that OpenSea has now fixed the vulnerability.",OpenSea,100000,Contract Vulnerability,http://chainb.com/?P=Cont&id=32317,927

During the deployment of the upgradeable smart contract, the dYdX security module made an error, which caused the ratio of DYDX to stkDYDX to change from 1 to 0, so that users who pledged DYDX did not receive stkDYDX. dYdX stated that the error was caused by an error in the smart contract deployment process.

At present, user funds are safely locked in the security module until the end of the 28-day epoch, and no security module rewards are distributed and no withdrawals are possible. In order to restore the contract function, an upgrade is required.

"June 23, 2022 - Harmony's Horizon Bridge was exploited by an attacker resulting in losses of roughly $100M. The bridge was secured by multisig wallet which needed 2 out of 5 wallets to confirm transaction. The hacker gained control over 2 wallets which enabled the attacker to drain the funds of the bridge and transfer said funds to his wallet.Details of the Exploit For yet unspecified reasons the attacker gained access over 2 of the 5 multisig wallets.The attacker was able to enter and confirm transactions by himself. The exploit resulted in the loss of: ETH, USDC, WBTC, USDT, DAI, BUSD, AAG, FXS, SUSHI, AAVE, WETH, and FRAX. The ONE token was not affected by this attack.For more context, bridges in DeFi are used to enable interoperability between blockchains. Through bridges a user of DeFi may pursue opportunities in an ecosystem that is not native to the coins or tokens a user is holding. For example through Harmony's Horizon Bridge a user holding $ETH on the Ethereum network could bridge $ETH over to the Harmony blockchain receiving newly minted wrapped $1ETH on a 1:1 ratio. Since the funds on the bridge were seized by the attacker, the receipt was no longer backed by the collateral on a 1:1 ratio. The depreciation of the wrapped assets were felt by users in the form of massive slippages on dexes and other bridges as users tried to flee the Harmony Ecosystem.Below a breakdown of the specific function used by the attacker.1) The multisig owner called the submitTransaction(), then to confirm owner calls confirmTransaction() from the MultiSigWallet with the input transactionId 21106.2) The executeTransaction() function has made an external call with input that will call the unlockEth() function in the Ethmanager contract. The input specifies the amount, recipient, and receiptId to be passed to the unlockEth() function.3) The following steps were repeated with different ids.Block Data ReferenceAttacker transactions:640K BUSD: https://bscscan.com/tx/0x4ed7941394725e49e7423e56553901c4ce841792c70e87adeee282cd78500668Link to attacker draining bridge for ERC20 tokens: https://etherscan.io/address/0x0d043128146654c7683fbf30ac98d7b2285ded00#tokentxnsMultisig wallet addresses that were compromised:1) https://etherscan.io/address/0xf845a7ee8477ad1fb4446651e548901a2635a9152) https://etherscan.io/address/0x812d8622c6f3c45959439e7ede3c580da06f8f25These addresses confirmed the transaction with id 21108.

"November 01, 2021 -  The Squid game project has been rug pulled by its team by way of blacklisting users from selling the $SQUID token. Investors were collectively alleviated of approx. $ 5,7 million.Details of the Exploit The Squid game project was inspired by the hit Netflix show and promised to be a play to earn game, hereby resembling the actions in the series. The hype surrounding the Netflix show combined with the increased interest in crypto due to the bull market incentivized big news outlets such as BBC and CNBC to write about the rapid surge in price of the new $SQUID token. Retailers around the world pushed the price from $0,01 to $2,861 in little over a week. CoinMarketCap published a warning concerning this project from the start as early investors reported that the sell of the token on pancake swap was not possible. A look at the smart contract revealed that all 3 contracts: SQUID, Marbles, and MasterChef were upgradable. Meaning the contract deployer would change the mechanisms of the project at will.For example a new MasterChef made it possible for the 0x71 EOA to withdraw all tokens from the MasterChef contract at the following transaction:https://bscscan.com/tx/0xf7c9d0e5a81999f9e06fe78df7ce41da112d8bd4f2da7b16cfdbbe46c92cb6afThe Squid game project boasted two token. The $Marbels token was required in order to be eligible to sell $SQUID on the open market. $Marbles were not tradable on the market and could only be obtained by participating in the game with an entrance fee of $SQUID 456. Meaning at the all time high price of the SQUID token a withdrawal would have costed at least $1,3 million.The contract deployer also blacklisted all users that did not hold Marble's token to prevent from selling SQUID in this transaction:https://bscscan.com/tx/0x5b82e96fccaa9ccc3255b509df51d127aa7ad402624f07683855d0e1c4555041Block Data ReferenceInvolved EOA addresses:https://bscscan.com/address/0x71d934aa2119ca3995f702f075d540f7a6b0f728https://bscscan.com/address/0x34400280a169f4685193926a513618cf7fe7f0aahttps://bscscan.com/address/0x1f5eabba9c56bca4a7828969b79bc87051125b31https://bscscan.com/address/0x3228eea3d2b7118f09f13a936f26c54e8f9bfb650x32 invoked the internal protocol's contract which worked as the interface of the PancakeSwap pair contract to sell SQUID tokens at multiple transactions under the ""0x5c2a8729"" method:https://bscscan.com/address/0x3228eea3d2b7118f09f13a936f26c54e8f9bfb65Example of ""0x5c2a8729"" transaction:https://bscscan.com/tx/0x98a07fde52914566a72b7eeb2ec1b1af3cb9a0a1d817bb1fb8d6d204993ae96aThe WBNB recipient was EOA, marked as SQUID Token Rug 2, which then deposited stolen funds into Tornado Cash Proxy:https://bscscan.com/address/0x34400280a169f4685193926a513618cf7fe7f0aa2 unverified smart contracts were used to sell SQUID tokens:https://bscscan.com/address/0x95eb532f23a97191324103755332a3dff97d722fhttps://bscscan.com/address/0x5b871670d4f1d81591ecf641588a28f5032c9dcd",Squid Game,5723268.0,"{'id': 10, 'type': 'Rugpull'}","https://cryptopotato.com/squid-game-pulls-the-rug-squid-price-crashes-99-99/, https://www.cmnnews.live/squid-game-rugpull-from-2856-to-0-0008-in-10-minutes/, https://twitter.com/TrustWallet/status/1455148681351483393, https://twitter.com/CoinMarketCap/status/1455183210149818371",1447

The Solana-based Nirvana protocol suffered losses of $3.5M.Details of the ExploitNirvana is a sustainable mechanism of wealth creation due to the growing minimum price. The $ANA and $NIRV token functioned as a balance between profitability and risk.Nirvana Finance has been subjected to a flash loan attack on the Solana network. The attacker took a flash loan during which he managed to manipulate the price and change the value of $ANA from $8 to $24.27 per transaction. Using the Solend Protocol , the attacker borrowed 10M $USDC which were used for exploiting Nirvana. He minted $ANA in worth of 10M $USDC then swapped $ANA for $USDT taking a profit of $3.5M which then were bridged through the Wormhole Bridge into the Ethereum network.

This allowed the exploit contract to use those LP tokens as collateral for borrowing crypto assets from Cheese Bank- raised the CHEESE price at UniswapV2 by swapping 20k ETH to 288k CHEESE, making the UNI_V2 LP tokens more valuable as collaterals Cheese Bank. This is the crucial step in this incident since the Cheese Bank uses the amount of WETH in a liquidity pool to estimate the price of the corresponding LP token. The manipulated UNI_V2-CHEESE-ETH pool (with 20k+ WETH) allowed the attacker to drain all the USDC, USDT, and DAI withheld by Cheese Bank by legit borrow() calls- refreshed the price feeds of Cheese Bank. The attacker intentionally invoked the CheesePriceOracle::refresh() function to refresh the price of the UNI_V2-CHEESE-ETH LP token which is derived from the amount of WETH in the liquidity pool and the ETH price derived from the UNI_V2-USDT-ETH pool. Specifically, the CheesePriceOracle::fetchLPAnhorPrice() function gets the wEthBalance of UNI_V2-CHEESE-ETH contract. With the passed in ethPrice, the totalValue is derived by wEthBalance x 2 x ethPrice. Therefore, the unit price of the UNI_V2-CHEESE-ETH LP token is computed by totalValue / totalSupply of LP tokens. It means if the attacker could somehow increase the amount of WETH in a pool (e.g., addLiquidity() with flash loan ether), the price of the LP token would be increased- drained the USDC, USDT, DAI withheld by Cheese Bank by borrow() calls. Besides the 2M USDC, 1.23M USDT and 87k DAI are borrowed from Cheese Bank. The exact balance of USDC/USDT/DAI is borrowed by the exploit contract- swapped 288k CHEESE back to 19.98k ETH at UniswapV2- swapped 58k USDC to 132 ETH at UniswapV2- collected assets into https://etherscan.io/address/02b7165d0916e373f0235056a7e6fccdb82d2255- repaid 21k ETH flashloan to dYdX.",Cheese Bank,3300000.0,"{'id': 15, 'type': 'Flash Loan Attack'}","https://cheesebank2020.medium.com/cheese-bank-detailed-statement-a765372dd84f, https://peckshield.medium.com/cheese-bank-incident-root-cause-analysis-d076bf87a1e7",1450

"August 09, 2022 - An attacker managed to compromise the Curve Finance website through a DNS attack and made away with approx. $612k worth of stablecoins.Details of the ExploitCurve.Finance is a backbone DeFi application, which does not only serve as a main focal point for institutional players with its stablecoin pools but also revolutionized Tokenomics by introducing the $CRV token rewards.An attacker managed to compromise the Curve.Finance website and redirect users to a malicious website, that extracted funds out of users wallets that interacted with it. This example transaction shows how the malicious smart contract transferred funds out of a users wallet to the attacker https://etherscan.io/tx/0x525fb894ed485b2cbdbdfaccedc3d405ba0f4659816ca4b639be7dd22e31a5e4.At the time of this writing  362.8 ETH has flown out of the attackers wallet, with the majority of funds flowing to the CEX's FixedFloat (292 ETH) and Binance (20 ETH).Curve.Finance found the problem and fixed it and urges all its users to check if any approvals to the malicious smart contract were given

The project promised its holders an array of off-chain benefits such as exclusive events, signed prints and virtual AMAs with a strategic orientation towards women's empowerment.Within the next day after the minting of the project took down its official Instagram account.Moderators on discord still encouraged members to buy more NFTs.
